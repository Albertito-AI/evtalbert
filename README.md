## Overview

EVT-Albert turns Puni’s model of emotional–volitional training into a **practical, trackable system**.  
It allows you to:

- Log training or performance sessions (sport, advocacy, teaching, or research).  
- Capture **pre-start states** (alertness, fever, apathy), obstacles, regulation methods, and outcomes.  
- Compute a **Volitional Index (VI)**: purposefulness, persistence, self-control, decisiveness.  
- Generate a Markdown dashboard (`analytics.md`) that can be auto-published in your GitHub repo.  
- Export structured logs to CSV (with anonymization support).

This project makes emotional–volitional preparation **auditable, repeatable, and shareable**.
